# MyShowsLibraryProject is my project made for SoftUni ASP.NET Advanced Course

My project is basicaly shows library for displaying movies and series split in user and admin area. 
Users can browse in the app, search up movies or series from a vast veriety in many genres,
view information about them, such as summary, crews, trailer, see people opinion for a given show in
form of reviews or be the judge and leave a review. In case the user likes some movies or series he can add
it in a list called watch later. Admin on the other hand can manage all movies, series or crew's information 
by adding, editing or deleting them, giving crews roles or movie genres, adding crews to movies and series and more.
